## 10/23/2025 - made the schematics  

ok, so i made schematics, i wanted to add extra things, like potentiometer to adjust the volume and screen brightness, i havent spent that much on it tbh, but i think its already a good start.
also here is the schematics 
![schema](https://github.com/YoussefDevPro/heidi-keyboard/raw/main/schematics.png)  

## 10/24/2025 - remade the schema  

so yeah, i wasnt really happy with the micro controller i used before, and it will also be hard to find one here, so i decided to use the classic rpi pico, i also used the TRRS to connect the other half, im still not sure abt this part tho, this will ofc use the QMK frimware, also thats the schema for the left (master half) keyboard

## 10/25/2025 - finished the schematics :yay:  

ok, so i corrected some errors i made last time, i also added a rotary encoder for each side to controll volume and brithness, and i added a led to know that the kb is on, now ima start working on the footprints

now im gonna start working on the actual pcb etc, might finish today hopefully
  

## 10/29/2025 - finished the master side of the pcb  

so yeah, i made the pcb, it was pretty hard, and for the usb-c, i had to connect it to a fan pin, then i will modify a micro usb cable so i can connect this to the usb-c, i will prob use pin sockets for the pico, bc i want things to be modular, and yeah, i think thats it

## 10/30/2025 - reworked the master half pcb  

so yeah, i decided to rework it, as i find out i made some mistakes lol, like i connected the GND to the RX wire accidentally, and i just found that i can make the pcb even better, so i organised it and also added some heidi pics :3, thats how the pcb looks like (with raytracing on a i5 gen 3 )

## 11/1/2025 - done the slave half and backlight for keys  

so yeah, i made the other half, worked the wiring again, and uh, added backlight for each key, absolute pain, not a good idea, and uh,  I FORGOT THE NET THING, and uh, everything dont have a net, so DRC IS COMPLAINING, but ill let him cry until i find the mood to do it
